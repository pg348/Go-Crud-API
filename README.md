# This is a basic API implementation in Go. Here's a short description

The code sets up a simple API server that listens on port 4000.

- The Course struct represents a course, and it has fields like CourseId, Coursename, CoursePrice, and Author. The Author field is a nested struct with fields for the author's full name and website.

- A slice named courses is used as a fake database to store course data.

 - The API server defines several routes using the Gorilla Mux router. These routes include handling requests for the home route **(/)**, getting all courses** (/courses)**, getting a specific course **(/course/{id})**, creating a new course** (/course with POST)**, updating a course **(/course/{id} with PUT)**, and deleting a course **(/course/{id} with DELETE)**.

- The corresponding controller functions are implemented for each route. These functions handle the HTTP requests, perform operations on the courses data, and write the responses back to the client.

- The createonecourse function generates a unique ID for the new course by using rand.Seed and rand.Intn functions. It assigns the generated ID to the CourseId field of the incoming course and adds it to the courses slice.

- The updateOneCourse and deleteOneCourse functions find the course based on the provided ID in the route parameter, update or delete it from the courses slice, respectively.

- **This is a basic skeleton of an API that can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on course data**.
